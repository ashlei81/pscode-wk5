// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

clear 
echo "10"
read a 

echo "20"
read b 

echo "30" 
read c 

echo "40" 
read d 

echo "50"
read e 

sum='expr $a + $b + $c + $d + $e'
avg='expr $sum / 5'

echo "Sum = $sum"
echo "Average = $avg"
10
 create function that finds smallest and largest numbers
  print Sum, min, max, avg
